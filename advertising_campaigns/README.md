📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis: Food Delivery Service

Project Overview

A food delivery service invested 250,000 RUB into two separate advertising campaigns to attract new users.

Campaign #1 acquired 171 users.

Campaign #2 acquired 236 users.

At first glance, Campaign #2 appears more successful due to a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and higher volume of users. However, this project demonstrates why relying solely on acquisition volume is misleading. By calculating unit economics and LTV, we reveal the true efficiency of the marketing spend.

Here is a concise and professional description for your GitHub project, structured as a README.md file.

I have incorporated the specific data from your screenshots (ROI, CAC, Retention trends) to make the case study sound robust and result-oriented.

📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis: Food Delivery Service
Project Overview
A food delivery service invested 250,000 RUB into two separate advertising campaigns to attract new users.

Campaign #1 acquired 171 users.

Campaign #2 acquired 236 users.

At first glance, Campaign #2 appears more successful due to a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and higher volume of users. However, this project demonstrates why relying solely on acquisition volume is misleading. By calculating unit economics and LTV, we reveal the true efficiency of the marketing spend.

The Business Problem
Stakeholders requested a comparison of the two channels to determine which was more effective. The goal was to move beyond vanity metrics (user count) and analyze the financial viability of each cohort.

📈 Key Metrics Analyzed
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): Cost to acquire a single paying user.

ROI (Return on Investment): Profitability of the ad spend.

Retention Rate: How many users returned after the first purchase.

Cumulative ARPPU: Average Revenue Per Paying User over time vs. CAC.

💡 Key Findings
Based on the data analysis:

Deceptive Volume: While Campaign #2 brought in more users (236 vs 171) with a lower CAC (~1,068 RUB vs ~1,462 RUB), the quality of these users was significantly lower.

Retention is King: Campaign #1 showed a strong Day 1 Retention of 42%, whereas Campaign #2 dropped to 17%.

Profitability (ROI):

Campaign #1: Achieved a positive ROI of 14.50%. The Cumulative ARPPU crossed the CAC line (break-even) by Day 5.

Campaign #2: Resulted in a negative ROI of -1.61%. The revenue generated never covered the acquisition cost within the observed period.

Conclusion
Despite higher acquisition costs, Campaign #1 is the clear winner. It attracts high-quality, loyal users who generate profit, whereas Campaign #2 burns budget on users who churn immediately.
